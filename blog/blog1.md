# The Seal Impression of the Prophet Isaiah (2018)

**Posted on December 9, 2024**

Preface: This seemed like a pretty cool thing to do some research about, especially since it was found so recently. This will be my first and only blog post on my website as of now, which is really funny because it makes me seem like I'm a biblical scholar or student, which I am not. I am a computer science student and I will probably write only about computer security. But this funny in an ironic way, and I want the 25 points :)

## Discovery of the Signature

Isaiah is probably the greatest prophet in Israel's history. One might say he is the LeBron James of prophets. Evidence to suggest his existance would have great implications for both Christians and Jewish historians, and that is what brought me to research this topic.

In 2009, the Isaiah bulla was unearthed together with the Hezekiah bulla by Dr. Eilat Mazar and her team. The seal was discovered next to the massive Solomonic-period Ophel walls. However, Dr. Mazar was not able to complete her study of the Isaiah bulla until 2018. News of the discovery was finally released in February 2018.

So what was this bulla? It was a seal impression bearing the name of the Prophet Isaiah. This small but powerful find offers a direct link between the biblical figure Isaiah and the historical reality of 8th-century BCE Judah. The discovery and the fact that it was found next to the Hezekiah bulla not only sheds light on Isaiah’s role in the royal court but also raises questions about the relationship between prophecy and politics in ancient Israel.

## Descriptions of the Bulla

The inscription on a bulla, or seal impression, has sparked a debate over its interpretation due to some damage on the left side, likely caused by a thumbprint due to the string cord that bound the package beneath it. Despite this, the first line is clear: "Belonging to Isaiah...". The controversy centers on the lower part of the inscription, where only three letters are visible: "nvy", which could be part of the Hebrew word for "prophet" (nvy'), or it could indicate a patronym (a name such as "son of Nvy") or an ethnicon (a person from a place like Nob). While the possibility of "Nvy" as a name or place exists, it is more likely that the missing letter is an aleph, completing the word "prophet" (nvy'), as it fits the space and context. Further analysis of the bulla’s border suggests that the missing letter was indeed an aleph, supporting the reading "Belonging to Isaiah the Prophet." This interpretation is backed by the fact that "prophet" is a common word in the Hebrew Bible and fits the evidence better than other alternatives.

A recent discovery from Jerusalem reveals the inconsistent use of the Hebrew definite article "h" in titles and professions on inscribed bullae. The bulla, dating to the end of the First Temple period and found near the Western Wall of the Temple Mount, features two figures with the inscription "lsr‘r" (lesar‘ir), meaning "to the governor of the city," likely referring to Jerusalem. This bulla is significant because it omits the definite article "h" before the word "‘ir" ("city"), even though the article typically appears in the Bible, such as in 2 Chronicles 29:20, where it refers to "governors of the city." This discovery supports the idea that the use of the definite article before titles and professions was not consistent or essential during this period and was instead determined by the scribe's discretion. 

So as all good discoveries go, there are plenty of things left undiscovered and debated.

## Context and Implications

In the bible, Isaiah’s interactions with King Hezekiah focus on prophecy and divine intervention. When Assyria threatened Jerusalem, Isaiah assured Hezekiah that God would protect the city. After Hezekiah prayed, God miraculously struck down 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. Later, when Hezekiah fell ill and was told he would die, he prayed for healing, and God extended his life by 15 years, as Isaiah had prophesied. Through these events, Isaiah acted as God’s messenger, delivering both warnings and promises of salvation.

Long story short, they were best buddies and their seals being found within 10 feet of each other gives a bit more credibility to the story. 

One of the most interesting bits I found from an article is "However, the bulla was found just outside what is believed to be the royal Ophel bakery area. Perhaps the sack contained a food item. Even this fits: In 2 Kings 20:7, Isaiah ordered a “cake of figs” to be delivered to a sick Hezekiah."
